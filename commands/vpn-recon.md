Use the Skill tool to invoke `vpn-recon:vpn-recon` (the skill, NOT this command).

Do NOT invoke `vpn-recon:vpn-recon` as a command - that's what you're reading now. Invoke the skill named `vpn-recon:vpn-recon`.

This skill protects the user's real IP address through multiple security layers. Deviating from the protocol could expose their identity.
